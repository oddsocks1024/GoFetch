# Go Fetch!
## Summary

Go Fetch! is an early download manager for the Amiga. It attempts to
automatically download files for the user in a 'fire & forget' manner using
HTTP or FTP. It has an extensive AREXX scripting interface, which allows it
to be integrated with almost any application, such as web browsers, email
clients and IRC clients. Various prebuilt AREXX scripts are supplied to
integrate Go Fetch! with other software. 

Originally written under a shareware licence, Go Fetch! is now available under
the GPL v2, which supercedes any previous licencing.
