Q1. Go Fetch! says it can't open the preferences or profiles file, even though
    it exists in the right location, why?
<P>
A1. You may be running a background disk compression utility such as
    DiskExpander or stacker. Some disk compression utilities to not allow files
    to be created in READWITE mode. Please install it on an uncompressed
    partition.

Q2. Will you be adding HTTP support?
<P>
A2. Yes, but only for users with Keyfiles.
<P>
<P>
Q3. Are you going to add an FTP browser type window?
<P>
A3. Probably not, as this would be turning Go Fetch! into a conventional FTP
    client which is not my intention.

Q4. How do I create a profile from a complete URL?
    (e.g.ftp://www.whatever.com/pub/file.lha)

A4. Use the supplied AREXX script called browser.rexx.

Q5. I'm currently using Miami or Miami DX and sometimes I get the error message
    "Error associated with the bind command". Why?
<P>
A5. The short answer is, I don't know at the moment, but I'm working on it. A
    quick fix is to quit your TCP/IP stack and restart it.

Q6. Will Go Fetch! have locale support?
<P>
A6. Yes
<P>
<P>
Q7. I had a partially downloaded file, but Go Fetch! did not resume, why?
<P>
A7. The server containing the file does NOT support file resuming.
<P>
<P>
Q8. I like Go Fetch! so much, can I give you a lifetimes supply of FREE beer?
<P>
A8. Of Course! :)
