<P>
Go Fetch! is a specialised FTP client, designed to take the pain out of
downloading lots of files, or very large files. By supplying a simple queue of
files, Go Fetch! will happily just sit in the background and download them for
you, whilst you get on with other tasks like browsing the web.
<P>
Scenario 1:
<P>
There's a large file on an FTP server you really want, but it's 25MB in size.
You aren't really keen on leaving your machine connected to download a file that
large, because of your phone bill. Well, simply add it to the queue of files in
Go Fetch! and whenever you go online for whatever reason, Go Fetch! will download
some more of the file each time, until you've got the file.
<P>
Scenario 2:
<P>
There's lots of files on an FTP site you want, but they are spread across
different directories. You don't want to have to wait until each file has
finished downloading before getting the next. Well, simply add them to Go Fetch!
and they will all be downloaded while you get on with other tasks.
