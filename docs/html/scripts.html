<P>
These scripts are designed to integrate Go Fetch with other applications, for
example Aweb-II which allows you to automatically create profiles. Scripts for
the other browsers such as Voyager and IBrowse as soon as they have decent AREXX
ports.
<P>
If you have any AREXX scripts which integrate Go Fetch! into other software,
please feel free to E-Mail me them and you'll receive a FREE keyfile for future
versions of Go Fetch!
<P>
Please note that any submitted AREXX scripts will be distributed with future
versions of Go Fetch!. Upon submitting the author gives their permission for Ian
Chapman and Zeus Developments to distribute and modify the code. Any
modifcations would be commented as so in the source. The original author will
have full credits in the source.

Notes:<BR>
This script has only been tested on Aweb-II version 3.0 and therefore I cannot
guarantee it's compatibility with different versions. The installation procedure
may differ depending on your version of Aweb.
<P>
There are two ways in which you can use the script within Aweb. For maximum
flexibility you probably want to use both.
<P>
<B>Use: Method 1</B><BR>
<B>Installation in Aweb (via the AREXX Menu)</B>.
<P>
Method 1 uses the AREXX script in the AREXX menu of Aweb. This allows you to
mark text (as if you were doing a copy & paste) and selecting the AREXX script
from the menu, it will automatically create a new profile.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Open Settings Menu</LI>
<LI>Choose GUI Settings</LI>
<LI>Select the AREXX tab.</LI>
<LI>Press ADD and fill in the following fields.<BR>
    Title = Send to Go Fetch!<BR>
    Macro = <path to browser.rexx> AWEBSEL</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>Use: Method 2</B><BR>
<B>Installation in Aweb (via PopUp Menus)</B>
<P>
Method 2 uses the AREXX script in a popup menu. This allows you to press the
right mouse button over a link and send the link to Go Fetch! and a profile will
be created for you.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Open Settings Menu</LI>
<LI>Choose GUI Settings</LI>
<LI>Select PopUp TAB</LI>
<LI>Press ADD and fill in the following fields<BR>
        Type = Link Popup Menu<BR>
        Title = Send to Go Fetch!<BR>
        Command = RUN <path to browser.rexx> %u</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>Use from the command line</B>
<P>
rx browser.rexx URL <url> TO <download path> PATH <GoFetch Exe>
<P>
Where:<BR>
<B>URL</B>     is the site you want to create a profile for<BR>
<B>TO</B>      (optional) An Alternative download directory, otherwise the default is used.<BR>
<B>PATH</B>    (optional) The location of the GoFetch! executable if you want to automatically
        start Go Fetch! and Go.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
rx browser.rexx URL ftp://site.com/dir/anotherdir/file.lha<BR>
rx browser.rexx URL ftp://me:secret@site.com/yetanotherdir/kewl.txt<BR>
rx browser.rexx URL ftp.hello.com/pub/gofetch.lha TO work:<BR>
rx browser.rexx URL ftp://login:password@ftp.asite.com:2034/pub/file.lha TO work: PATH Work:comms/GoFetch!/GoFetch!
<P>
<P>
If Go Fetch! is not running then it will attempt to execute it, providing you
have specified its location on the command line. The script will then remember
the Go Fetch! location.
<P>
<B>Return Codes</B><BR>
Browser.rexx returns the following values.
<P>
0 = Success<BR>
1 = Go Fetch! is not running and could not be started<BR>
2 = Go Fetch! is not running and couldn't be located.<BR>

These scripts are designed to automatically start and stop GO Fetch! when you go
online. If the AREXX script finds profiles contained within Go Fetch! it will
tell Go Fetch! to GO, otherwise it will Quit Go Fetch!. When you go offline, the
AREXX scripts tells Go Fetch! to Stop and Quit.
